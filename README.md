# NeatoJS

- typescript first
- modular
- isolated, use the packages on their own
- no abstraction, you're using well-known libraries, almost no need for neato-specific google searches

> [!WARNING]
> This is not even near to complete, don't use it

## Packages
- @neato/router - http router based on fastify
- @neato/orm - mini ORM, it's just migrations, mapper and a query builder
- @neato/email - JSX based email template engine
- @neato/config - load configurations from various sources with type-safety and validation
- @neato/auth - fully fledged authentication system, including permissions

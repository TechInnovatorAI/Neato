Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed

Syntax highlighting in inlined code: `const ts = "test"{:ts}`, looks cool!

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.
